# Claude Crash Course Templates

Welcome to the **Claude Crash Course** repository! This repo contains three essential templates that will help you rapidly build and deploy AI-driven applications using Claude. These templates are part of a structured workflow designed to enhance your development process and help you code 10x faster.

## Overview

In this crash course, you will learn how to efficiently build AI applications by leveraging Claude's power. The templates provided here are designed to guide you through the entire development process, from generating a master plan for your project to fully implementing production-ready code.

### Templates Included:

1. **Generate Master Plan (`1_generate_master_plan.txt`)**:

   - This template helps you define the overall structure and purpose of your app. By answering key questions, you'll generate a `masterplan.md` file, which serves as a blueprint for the entire project.

2. **Stub Out Project (`2_stub_out_project.txt`)**:

   - After defining your appâ€™s structure, use this template to create a skeleton of your project. This phase focuses on setting up the basic architecture and stubbing out essential components, leaving placeholders for further development.

3. **Fully Code Out Implementation (`3_fully_code_out_implementation.txt`)**:
   - This template will guide you in transforming the stubbed-out project from Phase 2 into fully functional, production-ready code. You'll focus on implementing core features, building out your app, and making sure everything is well-structured and scalable.

## Why Use Claude?

Claude enables you to build apps faster than ever before by providing powerful tools for project management, real-time code generation, and streamlined workflows. Whether you are building a Next.js app or a Python project, Claude can help you automate complex tasks and manage your project's knowledge base efficiently.
