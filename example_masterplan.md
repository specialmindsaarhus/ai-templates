- Individuals looking to repurpose video content for multiple platforms

## Core Features and Functionality

1. Video Upload

   - Upload multiple video clips
   - Store uploaded videos using UploadThing

2. AI Processing

   - Transcribe videos using OpenAI's Whisper API
   - Summarize transcriptions into a 2,000-word summary using GPT-4

3. Prompt Configuration

   - Create and edit prompts for different social media platforms

4. Content Generation

   - Generate platform-specific posts based on video summaries and configured prompts

5. Results Management

   - Content

6. Prompt

   - ID
   - ProjectID
   - Platform
   - Content

7. GeneratedPost

   - ID
   - ProjectID
   - Platform
   - Content

8. Job
   - ID
   - ProjectID
   - Type (Transcription, Summarization, PostGeneration)
   - Status (Ready, Running, Completed, Failed)
   - CreationDate

## User Interface Design Principles

1. Clean and intuitive design using ShadCN components
2. Clear separation of different stages (Upload, Config, Run, Result)
3. Easy-to-use drag-and-drop interface for video uploads
4. Simple text areas for prompt configuration
5. Clear display of job status and progress
6. Easy-to-copy generated content in the Results stage

## Security Considerations

1. User authentication and authorization using Clerk
2. Secure handling of API keys for OpenAI and UploadThing
3. Proper data sanitization and validation for user inputs
4. Secure storage of sensitive information (e.g., transcriptions, summaries)
